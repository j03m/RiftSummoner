pinch/zoom/drag - buggy - over scroll
scrollbar - buggy (sluggish response)
Combat flock -
    search 2 slices
    flip x-axis
    5 tries - lock on closest unlocked
    reinforcements all reg in the same slice :/

- to much crowding
    Lock table
- goblins stop
- nexus not in target?



powers:
    assassin -
        gun shot - 50% health reduce
        air strike
    elf archer -
        poison cloud
        rain poison
    Stone elemental
        quake - cracks ground, punches ground
        throw boulder?
