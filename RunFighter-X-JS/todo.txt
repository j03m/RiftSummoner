Buglist -

    *Missiles need to start at the characters attacking edge
    *Missiles need a set velocity, right now they slow down when the character gets close.
    *Tanks need to assess if they are still close enough to the target (per knockback)
    Characters need to face who they are attacking
    The players characters need some sort of indicator, green or red arrows above heads?
    *adjust shadows right for flipx

    *clip rect?
    *remove missile + effects - check perf on phone
    *if better, cache one missile + effect per soldier
    *do the same for heals
    *For area heals, cache the effects once tehy are applied.
